## Overview
I spent about 9h on home assignment - do not proceeding due to guide line of "spent up to 6h"
Have not used any vendors - to show my knowledge. Only used icons vendor.
App is designed for a desktop only.
 
### Implemented features:
#### Story 1 - List Alerts
 
#### Story 2 - Create Alert
  Creation is done via modal
 
#### Story 3 - Alert Details
  Full alert details is shown on a list view. For the future, modal could be used, similar to creation flow.
 
#### Story 4 - Search Alerts
  Added Search filter, but current api does not have capability to filter by search query, only by status.
  So Im filtering current alerts page. Should be change to api.
 
#### Story 6 - Alert Status Filtering
  Status filter uses filtering api.
 
#### Story 5 - Visualizing the Alert Status
#### Story 7 - Extending the Dashboard Page
  Both items are not implemented, have no time left. On a dashboard I was planing to implement charts using D3.js:
    - Pie chart to visualize status of open/closed alerts
    - Timeline chart or bar chart to visualize open/closed alerts by time range.
 
### Few notes
- To bootstrap app, JAVA is required - not listed in a README.
- I suggest to open frontend-assignment repo for a pull requests, it would be easy to track changes, check development process and so on.
